This latest crisis doesn't only give me a headache, it also gives me (a lot of) time to think. For a few days I have had the idea I might want to contribute more to a sustainable world. And where better to start than close to home? In the world of tech.

I started asking colleagues and friends how they think we could make our field of work more sustainable. I will call it tech, just because it sounds less dusty than IT and Digital Technology  is such a long word. 🤷‍♂️

## What can we do?
During a discussion I started with my mastermind group with the question: Do you have any ideas about how we [developers & designers] can attempt to work more sustainably?

During the discussion that followed my friend Stef came up with a definition of sustainability: "Is it finding a balance between people, planet & economy?"
I kind of agree, if you all other living beings are part of 'planet'. Wikipedia defines three similar domains: environment, economic and social.

I don't want to spend too much time on semantics, I think we all have an idea what I am talking about. And that's why I asked a question. What can we can we do?

For now we came up with a few themes and keywords:

- Remote & distributed work
- Digital wellbeing and humane design
- User tracking (privacy)
- Right to repair
- Sustainable energy usage - emission free hosting, low energy consuming hardware, like ARM-based architecture in devices like phones / raspberry pi
- Less consumerism

Those first three resonate the most (or easiest) with me. Although I would strongly support themes like right to repair. Building more sustainable hardware would make a huge difference.

### Remote & distributed work
I think there's so much potential to work in a way more flexible way than most people are used to. And I am convinced many organizations will be discovering the value in that during this time of forced working from home.

### Humane design
Focusing on features that actually make people happier and healthier is also something I'd love to see more instead of focusing on how to win and keep attention by using dark patterns that are thoroughly regulated in casinos while we set our kids loose on Facebook.

### Privacy
In privacy a lot more is happening already, with recent changes in European laws. You might complain about those cookie walls, but they give us insight and opportunity to choose if and how we let ourselves be tracked.

## How can we make a difference?
This is just a personal exploration, but I might write a bit more about this in the time to come.

Without diving too deep in it, I want to ask you first:

> How do you think we can contribute to a more sustainable world through my line of work?
