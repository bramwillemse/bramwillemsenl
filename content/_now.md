## Keeping busy

- **I have started work at [Bidfood](https://bidfood.nl)**, a Dutch hospitality wholesale company, part of a bigger international enterprise.
- **I have been running [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/ "Read about Home Assistant")** on a Raspberry Pi for a while now. It's a great open source operating system for my smart home. It makes paid, cloud-based services like IFTTT a thing of my past. Great fun!
- **My girlfriend recently moved in with me.** ðŸ’œ Which still brings enough DIY jobs to do in the house and garden for the time to come, like: a garden shed (for bikes and tools), a sliding wall to separate our sleeping space from the rest of the house and more.

## Personal development

- On a bi-weekly basis **I am meeting up with my Mastermind group** with 2 befriended colleagues. We help keep ourselves and each other accountable for our personal development goals and discuss themes we run into while doing so.
- **I am currently reading** [Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9833.Blind_Willow_Sleeping_Woman "Read about Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman by Haruki Murakami on GoodReads") by Haruki Murakami (one of my favourite authors), [The Culture Map](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22085568-the-culture-map "Read about The Culture Map by Erin Meyer on GoodReads") by Erin Meyer, [Why We Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep "Read about Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker on GoodReads") by Matthew Walker, [The Professional Product Owner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133269-the-professional-product-owner "Read about the Professional Product Owner by Don McGreal on GoodReads") by Don McGreal.

## Keeping calm &amp; fit

- I **started bouldering** in 2021 and I love it. I try to do it twice a week and I've been climbing up until 6A+ levels.
- **I run**. After spending most my energy in keeping calm through a crisis and a home renovation, I steadily crawled out of my running slump since 2020.  No ambitious plans, but a healthy focus on getting fitter and fitter and running longer and longer distances. After some injuries and COVID (again) end of 2023, I aim to get in marathon form again and to run the Utrechtse Heuvelrug Trail (UHT) at least once. You can follow my progress on [Strava](https://strava.com/athletes/bramwillemse "Follow my training progress on Strava").
- **I am practicing yin yoga again**, after finding an awesome Amsterdam yoga school called [Tula Yoga](https://www.tulayogastudios.nl/). It's a great contrasting exercise next to running and bouldering.
