## Keeping busy

- **I have been working as a product owner at [Bidfood](https://bidfood.nl)**, a Dutch hospitality wholesale company, part of a bigger international enterprise. I will be helping them transition to a whole new e-commerce platform.

## Personal development

## Keeping calm &amp; fit

- I **started bouldering** in 2021 and I love it. I try to do it twice a week and I've been climbing up until 6B levels recently.
- **I run**. After spending most my energy in keeping calm through a crisis and a home renovation, I steadily crawled out of my running slump since 2020.  No ambitious plans, but a healthy focus on getting fitter and fitter and running longer and longer distances. After some injuries and COVID (again) end of 2023, I aim to get in marathon form again and to run the Utrechtse Heuvelrug Trail (UHT) at least once by 2024's end. You can follow my ups and downs on [Strava](https://strava.com/athletes/bramwillemse "Follow my training progress on Strava").
- **I am practicing yin yoga again**, after finding an awesome Amsterdam yoga school called [Tula Yoga](https://www.tulayogastudios.nl/). It's a great contrasting exercise next to running and bouldering.
