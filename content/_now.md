## Keeping busy

- Since 2020 I have been **working with FedEx Express** as a product owner, scrum master and front-end developer. Based on UX Research, A/B-testing and data analysis, my team is steadily helping reduce customer support cost by improving the online experience.
- **I am currently reading** [The Culture Map](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22085568-the-culture-map "Read about The Culture Map by Erin Meyer on GoodReads") by Erin Meyer and [The City We Became](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50308712-the-city-we-became "Read about The City We Became by N.K. Jemisin on GoodReads") by N.K. Jemisin.

## Personal development

- On a monthly basis **I am meeting up with my Mastermind group** with three friends. We help keep ourselves and each other accountable for our personal development goals and discuss themes we run into while doing so.
- I am actively using my personal **note taking system** in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), a markdown file based note taking app. Recently I have improved [my templates for daily notes and persons](https://gist.github.com/bramwillemse/5f0a34ff0b6c73b54c320f16caef4242 "Check out the gist for my Obsidian daily and person templates"), using the Dataview & Templater plugins for the first time.

## Keeping calm &amp; fit

- **I try to start most of my days** with a daily meditation by Sam Harris in [the Waking Up app](https://wakingup.com "Check out the Waking Up app"). In practice I haven't been getting to it regularly.
- I **started bouldering** in 2021 and I love it. I try to do it twice a week.
- **I run**. After spending most my energy in keeping calm through a crisis and a home renovation, I steadily crawled out of my running slump since 2020.  No ambitious plans, but a healthy focus on getting fitter and fitter and running longer and longer distances. Last October I rean the Amsterdam marathon. It was not a lot of fun, so I plan to fully get back to trailrunning after I recovered from my first COVID in November '22.  You can follow my progress on [Strava](https://strava.com/athletes/bramwillemse "Follow my training progress on Strava").
- If I don't go running in the morning, I'll start the day with **a quick yoga session** consisting of the [5 Tibetans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Tibetan_Rites "Read more about the Five Tibetan Rites on Wikipedia") or a video session by [Yoga with Adriene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTdBUmHDA4s&list=PLui6Eyny-Uzx-IzGg48K4aHGyBwtPh7Sw) on YouTube.
