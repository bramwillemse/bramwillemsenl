## Keeping busy

- Since 2020 I am **working for FedEx Express** as a front-end developer and designer. Based on UX Research, A/B-testing and data analysis, my team and I are slowly but steadily reducing cost by improving the customer support experience.
- **I am currently reading** [The Handmaid's Tale](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38447 "Read about The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood on GoodReads") by Margaret Atwood.

## Personal development

- On a monthly basis **I am meeting up with my Mastermind group** with three friends. We help keep ourselves and each other accountable for our personal development goals and discuss themes we run into while doing so.
- I am actively using my personal **note taking system** in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), a markdown file based note taking app. Recently I have improved [my templates for daily notes and persons](https://gist.github.com/bramwillemse/5f0a34ff0b6c73b54c320f16caef4242 "Check out the gist for my Obsidian daily and person templates"), using the Dataview & Templater plugins for the first time.
- I'm trying to get back to journaling on a daily basis. It is an attempt to clear my head, organise my thoughts or just to get my writing juices flowing every day.

## Keeping calm &amp; fit

- **I try to start most of my days** with a daily meditation by Sam Harris in [the Waking Up app](https://wakingup.com "Check out the Waking Up app").
- Before that I will do some **short yoga exercise**. Which often consists of the [5 Tibetans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Tibetan_Rites "Read more about the Five Tibetan Rites on Wikipedia") or sun salutations, plus a few extra core power and specific exercises prescribed by my physio.
- I **started bouldering** this year and I love it. I try to do it twice a week. With or without friends.
- **I run**. After spending most my energy in keeping calm through a crisis and a home renovation, I steadily crawled out of my running slump since 2020.  No ambitious plans, but a healthy focus on getting fitter and fitter and running longer and longer distances. Last October I rean the Amsterdam marathon. It was not a lot of fun, so I plan to fully get back to trailrunning after I recovered from my first COVID in November '22.  You can follow my progress on [Strava](https://strava.com/athletes/bramwillemse "Follow my training progress on Strava").
