## Keeping busy

- **I have been working as a product owner for [Spargle](https://spargle.nl "Read about Spargle's professional connectors") at [Bidfood](https://bidfood.nl "Check Bidfood's current webshop")**, a Dutch hospitality wholesale company, part of a bigger international enterprise. I will be assisting them transition to a whole new e-commerce platform.
- **I might have Post-COVID**. While still functional I am not exercising a lot, because doing that quickly causes a lot of [physical issues](https://www.rivm.nl/en/coronavirus-covid-19/post-covid). I'm still doing tests to exclude other causes and taking it easy on my stress levels.

## Personal development
- **I currently can't stop reading** [the Stormlight Archive](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49075-the-stormlight-archive "Read about the Stormlight Archive series by Brandon Sanderson on GoodReads") series by Brandon Sanderson. I'm eating fantasy for breakfast! ðŸ¤“
- **I still want to finish** [The Culture Map](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22085568-the-culture-map "Read about The Culture Map by Erin Meyer on GoodReads") by Erin Meyer, [Why We Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep "Read about Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker on GoodReads") by Matthew Walker, [The Professional Product Owner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133269-the-professional-product-owner "Read about the Professional Product Owner by Don McGreal on GoodReads") by Don McGreal and [the Kingsbridge series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/60161-kingsbridge "Read about the Kingsbridge series by Ken Follett on GoodReads") by Ken Follett.

## Keeping calm &amp; fit
- I **started bouldering** in 2021 and I love it. I try to do it twice a week and I've been climbing up until 6B levels recently. For reasons named above I am taking it a bit easier at the moment.
- **I will run again too**. After spending most my energy in keeping calm through a crisis and a home renovation, I steadily crawled out of my running slump since 2020.  No ambitious plans, but a healthy focus on getting fitter and fitter and running longer and longer distances. After some injuries and COVID (again) end of 2023, I aim to get in marathon form again and to run the Utrechtse Heuvelrug Trail (UHT) at least once by 2024's end. You can follow my ups and downs on [Strava](https://strava.com/athletes/bramwillemse "Follow my training progress on Strava").
- **I am practicing yin yoga**, after finding an awesome Amsterdam yoga school called [Tula Yoga](https://www.tulayogastudios.nl/). It's a great contrasting exercise next to running and bouldering and good for addressing Post-COVID symptoms too.
