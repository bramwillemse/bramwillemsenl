## Keeping busy

- **I am open to a new job as product owner or something similar**, after amically parting ways with [Bidfood](https://bidfood.nl "Check Bidfood's current webshop"). Since I am looking for some stability, I am even open to permanent employment, next to freelance jobs of course.
- **I might have (had) [Post-COVID](https://www.rivm.nl/en/coronavirus-covid-19/post-covid "read more about Post-COVID symptoms")** or at least some kind of stress response. So the last half year I've been struggling in keeping up my energy levels. I stopped running for a few months, took time for some medical checkups (all good ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) and now slowly getting back into it. Fingers crossed on getting back into proper training later this year!

## Personal development
- **I am currently reading** [Een Kleine Geschiedenis van Amsterdam]("Read more about Een Kleine Geschiedenis van Amsterdam on GoodReads") by Geert Mak. A Dutch book about the history of my town.
- **I still want to finish**:
	- [the Stormlight Archive](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49075-the-stormlight-archive "Read about the Stormlight Archive series by Brandon Sanderson on GoodReads") series by Brandon Sanderson
  (2/5 left)
	- [the Kingsbridge series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/60161-kingsbridge "Read about the Kingsbridge series by Ken Follett on GoodReads") by Ken Follett (1/3 left)

## Keeping calm &amp; fit
- **I will am picking up running again**. As stated above, I've been off running for a few months. Now getting back into it, starting from scratch is hard. Follow my ups & downs on  [Strava](https://strava.com/athletes/bramwillemse "Follow my training progress on Strava").
- I **started bouldering** in 2021 and I love it. I try to do it twice a week and I've been climbing up until 6B levels recently. For reasons named above I am taking it a bit easier at the moment.
- **I am practicing yoga twice a week** after finding an awesome Amsterdam yoga school called [Tula Yoga](https://www.tulayogastudios.nl/). I practice yin and hatha yoga. It's a great contrasting exercise next to running and bouldering and perfect for addressing Post-COVID symptoms too.
