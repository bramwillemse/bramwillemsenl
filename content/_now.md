## Keeping busy

- On July, 1st **I have started a new project with FedEx** as a front-end developer. I will be helping them out within my holy triangle of front-end development, design thinking and teamwork.
- **I am building my home**. Since January 23rd I have been the proud owner of the apartment I had been renting the previous 3.5 years. I am living with a friend right now and hope to move back in any day now. It will be beautiful!
- **I am reading** ['1q84'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10357575-1q84 "Check out the book '1q84' on GoodReads") by Haruki Murakami.


## Personal development

- Bi-weekly **I am meeting up with my Mastermind group** with three friends. We help keep ourselves and each other accountable for our personal development goals and discuss themes we run into while doing so.
- **I am not drawing many wolves** right now. This is a random idea I had at the start of the year and now I am trying to every week draw a wolf. To get better at drawing and to get to know an animal and my fascination for it. You can [see my drawings on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bramwillemse/albums/72157713134882542). I hope to pick it up again some day this year.

## Keeping calm & fit
- **I start my days** with a short yoga exercise and meditation. The yoga exercise consists of the [5 Tibetans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Tibetan_Rites "Read more about the Five Tibetan Rites on Wikipedia"), plus a few extra exercises from my physiotherapist. Following that I will do the daily meditation by Sam Harris in [the Waking Up app](https://share.wakingup.com/2abce0e26219 "Check out the Waking Up app"). Through this link you can get 1 month of free access to the app, no strings attached.
- **I run**. I had a small injury, so I've started 2020 very calmly. I plan to run my first ultra marathon (later) this year or in 2021, after failing this goal last year. But since most of my energy goes into my home renovation I can't properly build up a serious training schedule I need to run marathons again. You can follow my progress on [Strava](https://strava.com/athletes/bramwillemse "Follow my training progress on Strava").
