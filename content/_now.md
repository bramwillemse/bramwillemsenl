## Keeping busy

- Last year **I started at FedEx** as a front-end developer. I 2021 I will be helping them out with optimising their Self Support pages and applications.
- **I am enjoying my newly renovated home**. Last year I bought and fully renovated my home in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This year my goal is to enjoy it and step by step decorate and improve upon last year's major overhaul.
- **I am reading** [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44453047-the-longing-for-less "Read about Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones by James Clear on GoodReads") by James Clear and [Barefoot Running Step by Step](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10061242-barefoot-running-step-by-step "Read about Barefoot Running Step by Step") by Roy M. Wallack &amp; Barefoot Ken Bob. The latter is an interesting take on running technique from a barefoot running guru.

## Personal development

- Bi-weekly **I am meeting up with my Mastermind group** with three friends. We help keep ourselves and each other accountable for our personal development goals and discuss themes we run into while doing so.
- **I am not drawing many wolves** right now. This is a random idea I had at the start of last year. To get better at drawing and to get to know an animal and my fascination for it. You can [see my drawings on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bramwillemse/albums/72157713134882542). This year I plan to be less ambitious about this an other things, but I hope to keep drawing wolves and other creatures.

## Keeping calm & fit

- **I start my days** with a short yoga exercise and meditation. The yoga exercise consists of the [5 Tibetans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Tibetan_Rites "Read more about the Five Tibetan Rites on Wikipedia"), plus a few extra exercises from my physiotherapist. Following that I will do the daily meditation by Sam Harris in [the Waking Up app](https://share.wakingup.com/2abce0e26219 "Check out the Waking Up app"). Through this link you can get 1 month of free access to the app, no strings attached.
- **I run**. After spending most my energy in keeping calm through a crisis and a home renovation, I tend to crawl back out of this planned running slump. No ambition plans, but getting fitter and fitter an to run longer and longer distances. Hopefully at some point leading to running that first ultra marathon!
