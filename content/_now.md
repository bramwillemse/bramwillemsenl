## Keeping busy

- Last year **I started at FedEx** as a front-end developer, UX consultant and scrum master. Based on UX Research, A/B-testing and data analysis, my team and I are slowly but steadily improving their Customer Support pages.
- **I am enjoying my newly renovated home**. Last year I bought and fully renovated my home in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This year I am decorating and improving step by step upon last year's major overhaul and I was joined by a kitten called 'Eefje' in May.
- **I am currently reading** [Killing Commendatore](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38820047-killing-commendatore "Read about Killing Commendatore by Haruki Murakami on GoodReads") by Haruki Murakami.

## Personal development

- Bi-weekly **I am meeting up with my Mastermind group** with three friends. We help keep ourselves and each other accountable for our personal development goals and discuss themes we run into while doing so.
- I am actively using my personal **note taking system** in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), a markdown file based note taking app in which I am trying to apply a variation of the 'Zettelkasten' system.
- Inspired by friends I have started to try and write "Morning Pages" (I call them Daily Pages, because I write them at any moment of the day); 25 minutes of stream of conciousness writing. It is an attempt to clear my head and get my writing juices flowing.

## Keeping calm & fit

- **I try to start most of my days** with a short yoga exercise and meditation. The yoga exercise often consists of the [5 Tibetans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Tibetan_Rites "Read more about the Five Tibetan Rites on Wikipedia") or sun salutations, plus a few extra exercises from my physiotherapist. Following that I will do a daily meditation by Sam Harris in [the Waking Up app](https://share.wakingup.com/2abce0e26219 "Check out the Waking Up app"). Through this link you can get 1 month of free access to the app, no strings attached.
- **I run**. After spending most my energy in keeping calm through a crisis and a home renovation, I steadily crawling out of my running slump.  No ambitious plans, but a healthy focus on getting fitter and fitter and running longer and longer distances. In November I plan to run a 30km trail on Schiermonnikoog, my first race in 2 years! Hopefully at some point all this will lead up to running that first ultra marathon I've been aiming for the last few years! You can follow my progress on [Strava](https://strava.com/athletes/bramwillemse "Follow my training progress on Strava").
