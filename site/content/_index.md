    <h1>In 2016-2017</h1>
    <p>... I worked for the Amsterdam water company <a href="https://waternet.nl">Waternet</a> in front-end development and interaction design.</p>
    <p>I helped Waternet design and develop a conversational UI for new and moving clients, we laid a foundation for a map based application to provide more insight into water quality in and around Amsterdam. Most importantly I helped Dept and Waternet to incorporate design thinking into their organisation.</p>
