## Book
I'll kick off with the hardest choice. I read more books than I did in ages (or maybe ever), and because of that I also read a very varied collection of books.

I rediscovered fantasy. I loved Joe Abercrombie's _First Law trilogy_ and N.K. Jemisin's _Broken Earth trilogy_ equally. It is lovely to just disappear in a totally different world.

I finally read the runner's classic _Born to Run_ and was really inspired to give barefoot running a try again. And I could keep naming many other books, like [Shape Up](/book-basecamp-shape-up/).

But I would say _Homo Deus_ takes the cake. Because it is relatively easy to read (up until the last 100 pages maybe..) while Yuval Noah Harari gives you a mindblowing view on the possible future of human kind. It is amazing how he connects history, economics, technology, religion, biology and more into a comprehensive story.

Most importantly, he made me connect dots that I hadn't before in a way that I find a lot hard to explain. If you want to get a glimpse into human kind, which way we might evolve and how you can prepare yourself for it, read _Homo Deus_.

## Music
Balthazar delivered the best album with _Fever_. Lana del Rey delivered the best song. Venice, bitch! It sounds a lot harsher than the song itself:

## Film
Yes, Joe Pesci shined bright like a creased, old diamond, but it‚Äôs not the Irishman. It might not be the most original choice. But hey, I‚Äôm a Tarantino fan this probably is his second to last film. üò≠

{{<video src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ELeMaP8EPAA" caption="Trailer for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood">}}

Brilliant & brutal, classy & classic. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood takes the prize!

## Game
I don‚Äôt play games that much anymore. Most games cannot keep my attention for too long, like this year's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Awesome production value, but in it's essence a predictable game in a nostalgic packaging. I stopped playing the single player campaign right before the end.

Life is Strange 2 is a lovely, coming of age road trip adventure following two brothers who are running from the police after their dad died in a mysterious incident involving the younger brother.

They released 5 separate episodes and every one is different. It‚Äôs beautifully understated, yet  effective. Your actions have consequences, it often offers a different perspective on life or tiny parts of it and it dares to be human. I'm saving episode 5 for the upcoming holidays!

## App
Waking Up is not just a pretty app. It‚Äôs a whole new level of learning about meditation, consciousness and more. Read a bit more about it, in my note [on meditation](/note-on-meditation).

## Device
This year was all about my renewed love for the Apple Watch. I bought the series 4, the one with the bigger screen, and I hadn‚Äôt expected to love it as much as I do.

The bigger screen makes it feel more like a proper, good looking and functional watch. It‚Äôs health features do not only make me stand up after sitting for too long, but also motivates me by keeping fit.

One feature, being able to compare your activity with friends, is actually a nice way to get competitive. I did 2 week long competitions with my brother, and I won. Twice. Better luck next time, bro!

## Running shoe
I loved its looks and the engineering that went into the Nike Terra Kiger 5. I loved the promise of a more natural running style of the Vibram Five fingers. But in the end I had the best experience in the Altra Superior 3.5. It is comfortable (for the medium long distances), it is neutral, and it has got space for my super wide feet. A definite winner in 2019!

{{<figure src="images/2019-highlights/bram-willemse-altra-superior-3-5.jpg" alt="Looking down on red Altra Superior running shoes" caption="Altra Superior 3.5 running shoes">}}

Because of that and my ultra goal ‚Äì and because the Ginger Runner tells me so ‚Äì I'm looking forward to give the Altra Olympus a chance next year‚Äôs longer distances. ü§ó

## Car
I drove the latest Porsche 911 and then some. But I think the Mercedes EQC was the b... Nah. I don‚Äôt. üòè

{{<figure src="images/2019-highlights/bram-willemse-porsche-992-carrera-s.jpg" caption="Me acting like I own this car üò¨" alt="Bram posing in front of a Porsche Carrera 992 Carrera S">}}

The Porsche 992 Carrera S is a blast to drive, beautiful up to the last detail and just unmatched on it‚Äôs all-round high quality. It‚Äôs impressive how predictable Porsche is at being the best in this industry, like they are proving with building an impressive first Porsche Full Electric Vehicle too, with the Taycan.

_Thanks for trusting me with all the cars I have driven for you, [Rutger & Bright](https://www.bright.nl/tags/personen/rutger-middendorp)!_
