  So you know by now I have a problem with taking travel notes and I want to fix it. But how you ask? It&#8217;s gonna be great. It&#8217;s gonna be the best travel app out there. Together we will make travel-note-taking great again. It&#8217;s true!
</p>

I hereby promise that&#8217;s the one and only Trump-reference I&#8217;ll make here. Sorry about that. Let me tell you how I&#8217;m fixing my problem. Trust me, it&#8217;s huuuge!

_Didn&#8217;t read [the Travel Notes introduction][1]? D&#8217;oh!_

## The problem

_<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1l6DvDFssUqMnsFJNFnrRJ" target="_blank">&#8230; only one <span class="ss-icon ss-icon-regular">♫</span></a>_

So according to a huge group of very experienced, highly intelligent travellers (me ?), us travellers are facing a huge problem: Taking note sucks when it comes to travelling. Not because there are not good note taking apps out there. There are plenty. But because it&#8217;s not focused enough on our needs: we take notes for ourselves, but we tend to meet awesome people we want to share parts of them with.

So let&#8217;s make the sharing part easy too!

## The fix

_<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1LulvBNBZ8POEEayrYwoOx" target="_blank">&#8230; is in <span class="ss-icon ss-icon-regular">♫</span></a>_

So give us our personal travel journals and let us magically pull out a page to share with others while not losing the original page. Magic!

Do I make sense? I&#8217;m never sure.

## The result

All this results in an app I&#8217;m going to try and develop. So let&#8217;s talk about that. What does it do?

  1. ? Pick a location and add your travel notes
  2. ? Share it with awesome fellow travellers
  3. ? Let them make it their own (easy as pie!)

That&#8217;s all there is to it, really. It might sound like a lot of apps do this. But I haven&#8217;t found any that really do only this.

## The challenge

For now my focus will be on nothing more than three challenges:

  * picking the location
  * taking note
  * sharing notes

The former two being a design challenge, the latter mainly a technical challenge, since I plan to make proper use of existing sharing options in our operatings systems (Android, iOS, etc.).

## The opportunity

Later on I&#8217;ll have to focus on making it work offline – very important when travellling, user accounts and making use of the information you all will potentially be generating. I&#8217;ve already received suggestions for a map view, a Lonely Planet like travel guide-like presentation, a photo / video slideshow mode to tell people at home about your travels. There are many opportunities. But first things first: taking notes and sharing the love!
