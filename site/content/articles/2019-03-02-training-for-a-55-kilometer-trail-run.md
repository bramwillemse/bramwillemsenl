title: "Why I'm training for a 55km trail run"
introduction: "You might have noticed that I've registered for a big race this july.

## Big Bram
I went to university. Shit happened. I was unhappy/depressed for years and gained an unhealthy amount of weight. Showing off that sad, big kid, which I don't even really recognise as myself anymore, still is a neat party trick.
The good news is: I crawled out of it. I started eating healthy again an got back to inline skating again, tried going to the gym too. Big Bram was fading away.

## From bootcamp to running
I managed to keep up in the gym for a while, even though I hated exercising indoors. I had a short love affair with spinning for a while. Pushing myself to the limit on power and

After a few years (or quite a lot actually), I made some friends that did their own bootcamp style training. It caught on. I created a Facebook group and the group grew from three friends to a bunch of friends of friends and colleagues that pushed each other to train hard.
