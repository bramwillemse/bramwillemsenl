When will this end? How badly will I get sick? And my friends & family? Should I cancel my new kitchen? And my yoga subscription? Should I take any paid job that comes along? Should I move house? Should I cancel the renovation? Is it fair that I receive welfare now? Should I sell my Airpods Pro?

At least I know the answer to that last one (yes).
