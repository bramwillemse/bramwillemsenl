## Keeping busy
- **I am looking for a new freelance project**. I am open up to any work where I can help people create digital solutions, mainly websites, webshops and web apps. I am an experienced front-end developer & team lead, but I'm also more than capable of designing full websites on my own.
- **I am building my home**. Since January 23rd I am the proud  owner of the apartment I had been renting the previous 3.5 years. I've moved to an apartment around the block, and right now I am doing all the demolition work myself, preparing it for a contractor to make it livable and beautiful.
- **I am cutting costs**. Since the Corona crisis is hitting me and I have no foreseeable income, I am looking into cutting costs where I can and the options that governmental support for freelancers can offer.
- **I volunteer at Vluchtelingenwerk** [Dutch for "Refugee Work"]. Since November 2019 I have helping them out as a 'Wijkvrijwilliger' [or 'neighbourhood volunteer']. It means every week or other week, I would hang out with a refugee buddy and help him find his way in Dutch daily life. Right now I am not visiting him in person, but trying to call weekly to see how he's doing.
- **I write** about my personal development, apps and hardware that I test and use, and other developments in my work areas.

## Keeping calm & fit
- **I start my days** with a short yoga exercise and meditation. The yoga exercise consists of the [5 Tibetans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Tibetan_Rites "Read more about the Five Tibetan Rites on Wikipedia"), plus a few extra exercises from my physiotherapist. Following that I will do the daily meditation by Sam Harris in [the Waking Up app](https://share.wakingup.com/2abce0e26219 "Check out the Waking Up app"). Through this link you can get 1 month of free access to the app, no strings attached.
- **I run**. I had a small injury, so I've started 2020 very calmly. Right now I'm focusing on form, with help from my physiotherapist. And I have to pick up strength training again soon too. I plan to run my first ultra marathon (later) this year, after failing this goal last year. You can follow my progress on [Strava](https://strava.com/athletes/bramwillemse "Follow my training progress on Strava").
- **I am reading** ['Remote'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17316682-remote "Check out the book 'Remote' on GoodReads") by David Heinemeier Hansson and Jason Fried and I am (still) working on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes" title="Check out the book 'How to take smart notes' on GoodReads">'How to take smart notes'</a> by SÃ¶nke Ahrens.
- **I draw wolves**. This is a random idea I had at the start of the year and now I am trying to every week draw a wolf. To get better at drawing and to get to know an animal and my fascination for it. You can [see my drawings on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bramwillemse/albums/72157713134882542).
