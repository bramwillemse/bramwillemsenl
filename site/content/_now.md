## Where
- I live &amp; work in üìç **Amsterdam, the Netherlands**.

## Work
- **I am building my home**. Since January 23rd I am the proud  owner of the apartment I had been renting the previous 3.5 years. I've moved to an apartment around the block, and right now I am doing all the demolition work myself, preparing it for a contractor to make it livable again.
- **I'll be starting a new project** with my friends of the [de.foundation](https://de.foundation) soon.
- And **I am writing**, or trying to.. I am looking for some formats to regularly write notes and blogposts this year. I might resussitate my old 'Apps die er toe doen' [Apps that matter] and the Wolf Weekly (drawings) might join the ranks. Although I am struggling the latter, combined with my renovation work.

# Personal
- **I am a volunteer for Vluchtelingenwerk**. Since november I am helping them out as a 'Wijkvrijwilliger' [or 'neighbourhood volunteer']. It means every week or other week, I'll hang out with a refugee buddy and help him find his way in Dutch society.
- **I run**. I had a small injury, so I've started 2020 very calmly. I plan to run my first ultra marathon (later) this year, after failing this goal last year. You can follow my progress on [Strava](https://strava.com/athletes/bramwillemse "Follow my training progress on Strava").
- **I am reading** ['Permanent Record'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45995328-de-meeste-mensen-deugen "Check out the book 'Permanent Record' on GoodReads") by Edward Snowden and (still) working on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes" title="Check out the book 'How to take smart notes' on GoodReads">'How to take smart notes'</a> by S√∂nke Ahrens.
