## Where
- I live &amp; work in üìç **Amsterdam, the Netherlands**.

## Work
- **I am looking for new projects**. Preferably smaller websites that I can take on on my own, as a designer &amp; developer, or in a small team.
- In the meanwhile **I will update my website**. It is built with static site generator <a href="https://gohugo.io" title="Read more about static site generator Hugo">Hugo</a>. I'm learning about how to optimise my usage of the system and slowly trying to update the site in design and features.
- **I am reading** <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes" title="Check out the book 'How to take smart notes' on GoodReads">'How to take smart notes'</a> by S√∂nke Ahrens.
- And **I am writing**. I am looking for some formats to regularly write notes and blogposts this year. I might resussitate my old 'Apps die er toe doen' [Apps that matter] and the Wolf Weekly (drawings) might join the ranks.

## Private
- **I am building my home**. Since January 23rd I am the proud  owner of the apartment I had been renting the previous 3.5 years. In the spring of 2020 I will be doing a full blown renovation.
- **I am a volunteer for Vluchtelingenwerk**. Since november I am helping them out as a 'Wijkvrijwilliger' [or 'neighbourhood volunteer']. It means every week or other week, I'll hang out with a refugee buddy and help him find his way in Dutch society.
- **I run**. I had a small injury, so I started 2020 very calmly. But I plan to run my first ultra marathon (later) this year, after failing this goal last year. You can follow my progress on [Strava](https://strava.com/athletes/bramwillemse "Follow my training progress on Strava").
- **I am reading** ['De meeste mensen deugen'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45995328-de-meeste-mensen-deugen "Check out the book 'De meeste mensen deugen' on GoodReads") by Rutger Bregman and [Wind/Pinball](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24013720-wind-pinball "Check out the book 'Wind/Pinball' on GoodReads") by Murakami.
