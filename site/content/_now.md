- I live &amp; work in üìç **Amsterdam, the Netherlands**
- **I am building a home**. As of the 23rd of January, I will be the owner of the apartment I have been renting the last 3,5 years.
- **I am looking for a temporary place**. Since I'm going to fully renovate my apartment, I'll need to get out for a few months.
- **I am looking for a new project**. I took a bit of a hit doing my latest project, so I decided to take a break. It was nice to be able to focus on buying my house and preparing the ensuing renovation project.
- **I am a volunteer**. Since november I am helping Vluchtelingenwerk as a 'Wijkvrijwilliger'. It means every week or two weeks I'll hang out with a refugee buddy and help him find his way in Dutch society.
- **I run**. After my house is done, I'll get back to my goal from last year: run my first ultra marathon.
