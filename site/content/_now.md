## Location
- I live &amp; work in üìç **Amsterdam, the Netherlands**

## Work
- **I am looking for a new project**. I'm looking for a project where I can make a difference as a designer and developer. I'm happy to join your team, or help set up one to build on your website or web application.
- In the meanwhile **I will update my website**. It is built with static site generator <a href="https://gohugo.io" title="Read more about static site generator Hugo">Hugo</a>. I'm learning about how to optimise my usage of the system and slowly trying to update the site in design and features.
- **I am reading** <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes" title="Check out 'How to take smart notes' on GoodReads">'How to take smart notes'</a> by S√∂nke Ahrens.
- And **I am writing**. I'm working on a blogpost about my 2020 goals and looking for some formats to regularly write this year.

## Private
- **I am building a home**. As of the 23rd of January, I will be the owner of the apartment I have been renting the last 3.5 years.
- **I am looking for a temporary place**. Since I'm going to fully renovate my apartment, I'll need to get out for a few months.
- **I am a volunteer**. Since november I am helping Vluchtelingenwerk as a 'Wijkvrijwilliger'. It means every week or two weeks I'll hang out with a refugee buddy and help him find his way in Dutch society.
- **I am reading** <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45995328-de-meeste-mensen-deugen" title="Check out 'De meeste mensen deugen' on GoodReads">'De meeste mensen deugen'</a> by Rutger Bregman.
- **I run**. After my house is done, I'll get back to my goal from last year: run my first ultra marathon. In the meanwhile I'll just keep on keeping on!
